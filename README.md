# Urban Mobility Analytics Platform

A computer vision system that analyzes urban mobility patterns using traffic camera footage. This project uses YOLOv5 for object detection and custom analytics to generate insights about traffic patterns, pedestrian movement, and urban mobility.

## Features
- Vehicle detection and classification
- Traffic density analysis
- Movement pattern visualization
- Time-series analysis of traffic patterns
- Interactive dashboard for exploring results

## Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- YOLOv5
- Streamlit
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Plotly
